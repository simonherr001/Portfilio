        <p>Web Application Development is a lab that I am currently taking at CART. This is a class where I learn to create websites from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Javascript, HTML, and CSS are the coding languages used to create these websites. Javascript is basically the one that makes things function correctly. With JavaScript only you can make a clock, timer, calculator and more. Next is HTML or HyperText Markup Language, this is where all the headers and text go to. This is where you write all your titles and paragraphs and when you do write the text in HTML it will pop up on your website. Lastly Is CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, this is where you can change everything visually. You can change text font, change the size of the font or a picture, or change the colors of things. There are many things you can do with CSS, how I like to think about this is that it makes everything look beautiful.</p>

    <div class="para1"><p>During my time in CART we learned many things. We learned how to create websites from scratch by using coding languages. In order to write the code we had to plan for each website and what we used for that were some computer softwares. We were taught to use Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Classroom, Google Keep, Visual Studios, Lucid Chart, Adobe Sparks, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and github. These most of the things that we used but the main ones were Visual Studios, Github, and LucidChart. Visual Studios is where we write all of our code to make our websites. Github is so that we can keep track of everything like when and what I create using our code. Then for LucidChart, this is where we plan for our projects or write or make our wireframes for the website.
