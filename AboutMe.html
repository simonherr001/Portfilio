    <h1>Hobbies</h1></div>
    <p>What I really love to do in my free time is play games. I like to play a variety of games. This comes from mmo rpgs like Black Desert Online to fps games like Black Ops. Playing games is the main thing that I do during my free time. When it comes to sports I like playing basketball and volleyball. I'm not really good at playing sports but it is still fun to play with family and friends. Then my last hobby that I really like is I like to read, watch, and draw anime. Reading and watching anime gives me some entertainment. When I draw this stuff it takes time and when I do draw and finish there is a satisfaction or a feeling of being proud of yourself. I am also not that good at drawing but I still like to draw because it brings out creativity.

    <div class="four_year_plan"><h1>4 Year Plan</h1></div>
    <p>For my four year plan I am still trying to figure things out on what I want to be. So next year I am going to attend Biomed at CART. I am still trying out things and see I want to work towards that thing. So far I am thinking about something in nursing or engineering. But those may not be the only things because I can still get some experience. So after highschool I will attend community college if I still am not sure about what to do.
